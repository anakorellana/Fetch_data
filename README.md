# dataFetch
Uses useEffect and useReduce to manage fetch of online data

<h2>Description</h2>

App that fetches Hacker News articles. A search bar was added recently and a working pagination under the same function. Not sure if that is good pratice but it definitely works. Also, added more margins and made some usage of Bootsrap. 

<h2>Usage</h2>
Make sure you use http-server to be able to see your edits or just the app itself. In this App you will be able to:
-Type and search any article typed under the search bar
-There are normally going to be 10 articlesper papge that will be rendered when searching about a certain topic.


<h2>Support</h2>

<h2>RoadMap</h2>

The goal for this exercise was to use useState, useEffect adding hooks/ functions to be able to fetch data and perform other tasks in the future with said hooks. More components can be added to performm other tasks. If it's helpful feel free to add more components and also add more styling.
